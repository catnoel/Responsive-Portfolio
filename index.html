		<p>Catherine Noel, B’10, started feeling antsy shortly after she landed her first professional job as a portfolio accountant for a financial services firm.
	The office life, she explained, simply wasn’t for her. Instead, Noel wanted to continue the community-building work that she had begun as an undergraduate volunteer for a student-led organization called Social Change through Peace Games.</p>

	<br>

	<p>Noel started looking for new opportunities in Boston and quickly found the Massachusetts Promise Fellowship, a nonprofit AmeriCorps organization that is housed within Northeastern’s Center for Community Service. The organization places 40 fellows who commit to a year of full-time service at nonprofit organizations, schools, and city agencies across Massachusetts to create, lead and manage youth-development projects. The program also gives participants the option of taking free classes through the university’s College of Professional Studies.</p>

	<br>

	<p>At the beginning of August, Noel started serving with America Scores, a Boston-based urban youth-development program that combines soccer, mentoring and service learning. “Now I’m working with a group I really believe in,” she explained. “I’m working with more senior fellows who have experience, and I know what we’re doing is really making an impact.”</p>
